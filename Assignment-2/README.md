# Assignment-2

This assignment is a **4-page website**. It showcases Vecta Corporation with pages for **Home, About Us, Solutions, and Contact Us**, each linked with a navigation bar made up of images.  

## 🔗 Navigation  
Each page includes a **navigation bar made of image buttons** (`.gif` format). The buttons link to:  
- Home → `index.html`  
- About Us → `aboutus.html`  
- Solutions → `solutions.html`  
- Contact Us → `contactus.html`  

## 📌 Notes  
- All `<h2>` headings are used per assignment instructions.  
- Inline body style (`width:960px;margin:0 20px;`) is kept as provided in starter code.  
- Proper semantic markup is used (`<strong>`, `<em>`, `<address>`, `<ul>/<li>`).  
```

Would you like me to also include a **"How to Run"** section in the README (like “open `index.html` in a browser”) so it looks more professional?
